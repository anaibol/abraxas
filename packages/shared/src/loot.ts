/** NPC Drop related logic (moved STARTING_EQUIPMENT and KILL_GOLD_BONUS to config/) */

// Item 63: Enumify hardcoded channels (TODO)

// This file used to contain loot tables and starting gear.
// Starting gear is now in config/classes.ts
// Kill gold bonus is in config/npc.ts (or constants)

// No code needed here for now if everything was moved, 
// but let's see if there's anything else in loot.ts that's useful.
// (Emptying for now to resolve duplicates)
